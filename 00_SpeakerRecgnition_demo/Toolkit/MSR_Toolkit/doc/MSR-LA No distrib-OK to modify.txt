MICROSOFT RESEARCH LICENSE TERMS
These license terms (“MSR-LA”) are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to the software or data (“software”) they accompany, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft:
* updates,
* supplements,
* Internet-based services, and
* support services
for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.
By using the software you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the software. If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.
SCOPE OF RIGHTS. 
* License Grant. You may use, modify, and creative derivative works of the software for any non-commercial purposes, subject to the restrictions in this MSR-LA. Examples of non-commercial uses are teaching, academic research, public demonstrations and personal experimentation.
* Distribution Restrictions. You may not:
* distribute the software or derivative works in any form;

* use Microsoft’s trademarks in your programs’ names or in a way that suggests your derivative works or modifications come from or are endorsed by Microsoft.

You may publish (or present papers or articles) on your results from using the software, provided that no software source code or object code or documentation is included in any such publication or presentation.  Prior to publishing any publication describing your research with the software, you must submit the publication to Microsoft for review and approval.

TERM; TERMINATION. The term of this MSR-LA will commence upon your acceptance of these license terms and will continue indefinitely unless terminated as provided herein. If you breach this MSR-LA or if you sue anyone over patents that you think may apply to or read on the software or anyone's use of the software, this MSR-LA (and your license and rights obtained herein) terminate automatically.  If this MSR-LA is terminated, you must cease using and distributing any derivative works or modifications of the Software.  Any sections that are intended to survive termination of this agreement shall survive.
